 The user wants a layout for a survey called "The Answer Trap Risk Profile." Let's see what the specifications are.

First, the goal is to assess senior executives' risk of falling into the answer trap based on their answers. The survey has admin and user modes, with specific features for both.

Starting with the admin mode setup: the admin can configure everything, like questions, categories, score ranges, etc. The data should be saved so that when they return to admin mode, the previous entries are there. That suggests a form-based interface where the admin can input all the necessary details.

The survey structure includes introduction questions (drop-downs), categories with questions that have three possible answers each (buttons), and scoring based on numerical values assigned in admin. Each category's total score and the overall total are calculated.

The report page after the survey needs to show the score ranges, linked text files, and a visual graph. Also, color-coding for different ranges, so the admin can set colors for score ranges, which appear on the report.

User mode should present each question on a new page, with the survey title and banner always visible at the top. The user's answers are collected, and after completion, they can get a report via email or a link.

Now, about the layout. Let's think about the pages. The main pages would be:

1. Login page for admin access (using username and password).
2. Admin configuration pages where they set up questions, categories, score ranges, colors, etc.
3. User survey pages where each question is on a separate page.
4. The report page.

The admin setup would likely involve multiple forms or tabs. For example, setting up introduction questions, then categories, each with their questions and answers, assigning numerical values, etc. Similarly, configuring the score ranges for both overall and per-category, linking to text files, and setting colors.

For the survey pages, each question should be displayed one at a time, with navigation buttons (like next/previous), but maybe only next since the user proceeds through each question. The top part needs the title and banner image.

The report needs to display the scores, the corresponding text based on ranges, and the graph. The graph should show each category's score and the total as a percentage of the maximum possible. Also, options to email the report or get a link.

So, the layout would involve:

- A header section with the survey title and banner image, present on all pages except maybe login.
- For admin pages, forms with inputs, text areas, file uploads for images and text files, dropdowns for ranges, etc.
- User survey pages would have the header, the question text, three answer buttons, and navigation (like Next button).
- The report page has the header, the scores, text content based on ranges, the graph, and email options.

Now, considering storage and deployment. The data needs to be stored, so a database is required. The application can be built using a framework like Django or Flask for the backend, with React or Vue for the frontend. But since the user didn't specify, but mentioned using Koyeb for deployment, which is a cloud platform that supports web applications.

The color scheme is light blue background. So, the CSS should set the body background color to light blue, maybe #add8e6.

Repository on GitHub, but the user didn't specify, but the code should be version-controlled.

So, putting this all together into a design specification:

The Survey Design Specifications would outline the structure of each page, the elements present, their layout, and functionality. For example:

- Home/Login Page:
  - Form for admin login (username/password).
  
- Admin Dashboard:
  - Sidebar or tabs for different setup sections (Introduction Questions, Categories, Scores/Ranges, Email settings, etc.)
  
- Survey Interface:
  - Each question page has:
    - Header with title and banner.
    - Question text.
    - Three answer buttons.
    - Next button.
  
- Report Page:
  - Header with title and banner.
  - Total score and category scores displayed as percentages.
  - Graph showing the breakdown.
  - Color-coded sections based on ranges.
  - Text content from linked files for each range.
  - Email form to send report or link.

The design should be responsive, user-friendly, and secure. The server-side code should handle data storage, authentication, and ensure that only admins can access setup pages. User data should be stored with anonymization or proper privacy measures to comply with regulations, but the user might not require that level of detail here.

Now, creating a Survey DesignSpecification document would involve:

- Cover page with title.
- Table of contents.
- Introduction to the project.
- System requirements (like database, deployment, tech stack).
- Design overview:
  - Admin mode layout.
  - User mode layout.
  - Report generation.
- Detailed page descriptions:
  - Login page.
  - Admin configuration pages (e.g., setup introduction questions, categories, etc.)
  - User survey flow.
  - Report display.
- Wireframe sketches or mockups.
- Color scheme and style guidelines.
- Deployment and maintenance considerations.

But since the user provided a text box for the answer, I need to create a structured layout that aligns with these requirements. Maybe using a list or a table to outline each section.

Wait, the user wants the layout for the survey design specifications, not the actual database schema. So, the answer should outline the structure of the document that specifies the survey design.

So, the layout of the Survey DesignSpecifications document would include:

1. Cover Page
   - Title: "The Answer Trap Risk Profile Survey"
   - Subtitle: "Design Specifications"

2. Table of Contents
   - Sections like Introduction, System Requirements, DesignOverview, etc.

3. Introduction
   - Project purpose, goals.

4. System Requirements
   - Hardware, software, database, etc.

5. Design Overview
   - Architecture (client-server, web-based)
   - Key components.

6. User Interface Design
   - Admin Mode
   - User Mode
   - Report Page

7. Page-by-Page Design

   a. Login Page
      - Form elements.

   b. Admin Configuration Pages
      - Introduction Questions Setup
      - Categories and Questions Setup
      - Score Ranges and Colors
      - Email Settings

   c. User Survey Pages
      - Layout of each question page.

   d. Report Page Layout

8. Database Schema (maybe, but the user didn't mention, but if needed, outline the tables)

9. Security Considerations (authentication, data protection)

10. Deployment Plan (using Koyeb)

But the user wants a layout for the specifications document. So, perhaps a structured list that outlines the sections and subsections.

But the user's answer box allows for text. Let me think about structuring it with bullet points or numbered sections.

Alternatively, the answer might outline the layout of the survey application itself, not the design document. Wait, the question says "Survey Design Specifications layout for “The Answer Trap Risk Profile”", so the layout of the survey's design specifications. So the answer should be the structure of the document that specifies the design, not the survey's user interface.

Wait, maybe the user is asking for a layout of the survey application, but the answer needs to be a documentation layout. Hmm.

But the user's provided example response had a text box, which they filled with points about the survey's requirements. The user might want the answer to outline the structure of the documentation that specifies the survey's design.

Alternatively, the answer should provide a mockup or description of the visual layout of the survey and admin interfaces.

But given that the response must be text-based, maybe create a structure for the design document.

So, the answer would be something like:

The Survey Design Specifications document will have the following structure:

1. Introduction
   - Project Overview
   - Objectives
   - Target Audience

2. System Requirements
   - Hardware Requirements
   - Software Requirements
   - Database Design

3. User Interface Design
   - Admin Interface
     - Layout and Functionality
     - Forms and Input Fields
     - Data Persistence
   - User Interface
     - Survey Flow
     - Question Presentation
     - Navigation

4. Report Generation
   - Score Calculation
   - Visual Elements
   - Email Functionality

5. Security and Access Control

6. Deployment Plan
   - Platform (Koyeb)
   - Environment Configuration

7. Appendices
   - Color Codes
   - Wireframe Diagrams
   - Sample Screenshots

Each section will detail the specifications for that aspect of the survey application, ensuring that all design requirements are documented and can be used to build the system.

But the user's example had specific details like "In admin mode all the fields within the survey will be setup." So the answer should capture all those points in a structured way.

Alternatively, the answer should outline the pages and elements in the survey application as per the specifications. Let me try that.

The Survey Design Specifications layout for “The Answer Trap Risk Profile” will include the following elements:

1. Admin Interface:
   - Setup Forms:
     - Survey Title Field
     - Banner Image Upload

6. UI Style:
   - Light Blue Background
   - Responsive Design

This layout ensures that all the specified features are incorporated into the survey system, with a focus on usability, security, and visual clarity.

But the user's example had a text box where they wrote details. Maybe the answer should be a list of sections, each with a description. Let me format it accordingly.

The Survey Design Specifications for “The Answer Trap Risk Profile” will have the following layout:

1. Cover Page
   - Title: The Answer Trap Risk Profile Survey

   - Color Codes and Styling Guide

Each section will detail the specific requirements and design elements, ensuring that the survey application is built to the specified needs.

But the user's example had the answer in a text box, so perhaps the response should be written in a paragraph form with bullet points for clarity.

The design specifications for the survey will include the following key components:

- Admin Configuration:
   • Form setup for survey title and banner
   • Configuration for introduction questions and their answers
   • Setup for categories, questions, and answer options
   • Scoring ranges, text files, and color coding
   • Email settings for report delivery

- User Survey Interface:
   • Sequential page layout per question
   • Consistent header with title and banner
